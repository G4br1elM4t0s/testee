If you would like to use my custom pixelmon config which allows Players and NPCs to use mega evolution and tons of other changes that I personally think are better than default for this map, place the "pixelmon.hocon" file located in the folder you downloaded, into your .minecraft/config folder. BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL "pixelmon.hocon" CONFIG FILE IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY MADE CHANGES TO YOURS AND WOULD LIKE TO STILL HAVE IT!
